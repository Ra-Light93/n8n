People all over the internet got mad at this UFC fighter for punching his opponent multiple times, even though he was already knocked out. And when the interviewers asked him why he did it, his response was very unexpected. The punches weren't really necessary. They were super necessary. The referee hadn't pulled me off. Maybe you don't watch him and maybe go back to soccer. But little did he know that karma was on its way. As just a few months later, another fighter decided to give him a taste of his own medicine in the most satisfying way possible. I keep going until the ref pulls me off. Those are super necessary.
