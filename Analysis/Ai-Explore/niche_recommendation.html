        <h1>Niche Recommendation for Your n8n Workflow</h1>
        <p>This analysis is based on your plan to build an n8n workflow that creates and posts content primarily in a <strong>text and multi-image format</strong>. The ranking prioritizes niches that are well-suited for this format, have strong potential, and avoid excessive risk for a new project.</p>

        <!-- Rank 1: Best -->
        <div class="niche-item best">
            <div class="rank">1</div>
            <div class="niche-content">
                <h2>AI News & Tools</h2>
                <p><strong>Why it's the best choice:</strong> This niche is the perfect match for your project. It's a high-growth area with an enthusiastic audience, and your report notes it's less saturated than others. The content format (tutorials, reviews) is ideal for text-and-image carousels that your n8n workflow can automate.</p>
                <p><strong>Workflow Idea:</strong> Create a "New AI Tool of the Day" series. Your workflow can generate a 3-image post: Image 1 shows the tool's logo, Image 2 explains a key feature with text overlay, and Image 3 shows an example of its output.</p>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Research & Summary Tools</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>News Aggregators:</strong> Use Feedly or Inoreader to follow top AI blogs like TechCrunch, Ars Technica, and The Verge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> Subscribe to popular AI newsletters (e.g., The Neuron, Ben's Bites) for curated news.</li>
                    <li><strong>Academic Papers:</strong> Monitor arXiv for the latest research papers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Use an AI assistant like Gemini to summarize long articles or papers for quick content creation.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Estimated 3-6 Month Profit Potential</h4>
                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a speculative estimate and not financial advice.</p>
                <p><strong>Range:</strong> $50 - $700. Monetization would likely start with affiliate links for AI tools. With a growing audience, you could attract sponsorships from new AI companies, which would increase revenue significantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="niche-content">
                <h2>Finance (with a specific sub-niche)</h2>
                <p><strong>Why it's a strong choice:</strong> This niche has the highest monetization potential according to your report. The format of "Infographics & Carousels" is a perfect fit for your text-and-image workflow. You can create visually appealing posts that explain financial concepts.</p>
                <p><strong>Workflow Idea:</strong> Focus on a sub-niche like "Personal Finance for Beginners." Your workflow could create daily posts explaining one financial term (e.g., "What is a 401(k)?") with simple icons and text across several images.</p>
                <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Your report correctly flags the intense competition and legal complexities. Start with purely educational content and clear disclaimers.</p>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Research & Summary Tools</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Financial News:</strong> Follow major outlets like Bloomberg, Reuters, and The Wall Street Journal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational Sites:</strong> Use Investopedia for clear definitions and explanations of financial concepts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Data:</strong> Use Yahoo Finance or Google Finance for stock and market information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Insights:</strong> Monitor discussions on subreddits like r/personalfinance (with caution) to understand common questions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Estimated 3-6 Month Profit Potential</h4>
                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a speculative estimate and not financial advice.</p>
                <p><strong>Range:</strong> $100 - $1,500. This niche has very high monetization potential due to valuable affiliate programs (credit cards, brokerage accounts, financial software). The high end of this range depends on creating highly credible content that attracts a trusting audience.</p>

                <h2>Islamic Religious Content</h2>
                <p><strong>Why it's a strong choice:</strong> This niche has a massive, highly engaged global audience and the content is evergreen. The format of posting daily reminders with inspirational text and images is a perfect fit for your automated workflow.</p>
                <p><strong>Workflow Idea:</strong> Create a database of authentic Quranic verses and Hadith. Your workflow can select one each day, generate a beautiful background image (e.g., abstract Islamic art, geometric patterns), and overlay the text (Arabic and translation) using elegant fonts.</p>
                <p><strong>Caution:</strong> The responsibility in this niche is enormous. <strong>Absolute accuracy is non-negotiable.</strong> A single mistake in quoting or translating can cause offense and destroy your credibility. You must have deep knowledge to ensure the content is respectful and correct.</p>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Research & Summary Tools</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authenticated Sources:</strong> Use only reputable digital sources for verses and Hadith, such as Quran.com and Sunnah.com.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reputable Translations:</strong> Stick to well-regarded translations (e.g., Sahih International).</li>
                    <li><strong>Academic Resources:</strong> Consult academic Islamic resources to ensure proper context and understanding.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Estimated 3-6 Month Profit Potential</h4>
                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a speculative estimate and not financial advice. Monetization must be approached ethically.</p>
                <p><strong>Range:</strong> $50 - $800. Monetization would come from community support (Patreon/donations) or ethical affiliate marketing of relevant products (books, prayer apps, halal goods). Trust is the primary driver of revenue.</p>

                <h2>Celebrity News</h2>
                <p><strong>Why it's ranked here:</strong> The content format ("Photo Carousels," "Text-Based Updates") is a great fit for your workflow and has massive viral potential. However, your report highlights the extreme competition from large media companies and the need for rapid content creation, which could be challenging to automate effectively at the start.</p>
                <p><strong>Workflow Idea:</strong> You could automate posts for "On This Day in Celebrity History" to avoid competing with breaking news. For example, a post about a famous movie's release anniversary with stills from the film.</p>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Research & Summary Tools</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gossip & News Sites:</strong> Monitor sites like TMZ, Page Six, Variety, and People for breaking stories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Directly follow celebrity accounts and fan pages on X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok.</li>
                    <li><strong>Photo Agencies:</strong> Use public feeds from agencies like Getty Images to see recent event photos.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Estimated 3-6 Month Profit Potential</h4>
                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a speculative estimate and not financial advice.</p>
                <p><strong>Range:</strong> $20 - $500. Monetization in this niche is typically ad-based and requires very high volume. Early revenue will be low, but a viral post could significantly increase earnings. It's less stable than the top-ranked niches.</p>

                <h2>Political Commentary</h2>
                <p><strong>Why it's ranked here:</strong> While the text-and-image format works well, your report points out a significant risk of demonetization and the stress of dealing with a polarized audience. For a first automated project, this is a volatile and risky environment to enter.</p>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Research & Summary Tools</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Neutral News Wires:</strong> Use Associated Press (AP) and Reuters for factual, neutral reporting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Political News Sites:</strong> Follow dedicated outlets like Politico, The Hill, and C-SPAN.</li>
                    <li><strong>Think Tanks:</strong> Reference reports from non-partisan think tanks for in-depth analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Government Sources:</strong> Directly access public records and press releases from government websites.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color: #8e44ad; margin-top: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">Estimated 3-6 Month Profit Potential</h4>
                <p>A reliable profit estimate is not provided for this niche. As your report highlights, it faces a significant risk of demonetization. Revenue is highly unpredictable and can be heavily impacted by platform policy changes, making it too volatile to estimate for a new project.</p>

                <h2>AI-Generated Models: Hot Pics</h2>
                <p><strong>Why it's one of the worst choices:</strong> Your own report gives this a low score (50/100) and warns of "substantial ethical quandaries and significant platform-related risks, including potential bans." The risk of your accounts being shut down is extremely high.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> As this niche is strongly discouraged due to high platform risks and ethical concerns, specific research tools and profit estimates are not provided.</p>

                <p><strong>Why it's the absolute worst choice:</strong> This is a non-starter. Your report correctly identifies that this content is "unequivocally banned from virtually all mainstream social media platforms." Any automated workflow attempting to post this would be shut down almost immediately.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> As this niche is forbidden on all mainstream platforms and not recommended, specific research tools and profit estimates are not provided.</p>
