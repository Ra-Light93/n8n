        <h1>AI Tools Research: Image & Video Creation Costs</h1>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Introduction & Assumptions:</strong> This report provides an overview of leading and average-tier AI tools for image generation, image editing, video generation, and video editing (specifically for creating shorts). It includes their pricing models and an estimated monthly cost based on your specified usage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Images:</strong> 25 images per day = 750 images per month.</li>
                <li><strong>Video Generation:</strong> 5 videos per day = 150 videos per month. For pricing, we assume an average generated video length of 1 minute, totaling 150 minutes of generated video per month.</li>
                <li><strong>Video Shorts Creation:</strong> 5 shorts per day = 150 shorts per month. For tools that process existing video, we assume an average of 10 minutes of source video processed per short, totaling 1500 minutes of source video processed per month. If the tool charges per short, we use 150 shorts/month.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pricing is subject to change and may vary by region or specific features used. Always check the official websites for the most current information.</p>

        <h2>3. AI Video Generation</h2>
        <p>Tools that create videos from text, images, or other inputs using AI.</p>

        <h3>Top-Tier Tools</h3>
        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Google Veo 3</h4>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Generates high-quality, realistic videos with synced audio, cinematic realism, and advanced editing features. Considered a benchmark in visual quality.</p>
            <p><strong>Pricing Model:</strong> Credit-based via Google AI Pro/Ultra plans.</p>
            <p><strong>Estimated Monthly Cost (150 minutes generated video):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google AI Pro ($19.99/month) includes 1,000 credits. Google Veo 2 (older model) was priced at $0.50 per second. If Veo 3 is similar, 1 minute = $30. 150 minutes = $4500.</li>
                <li>This suggests a credit system where 1,000 credits might not cover 150 minutes. The Ultra plan ($249.99/month) offers 12,500 credits.</li>
                <li>Given the high cost per second for older models, generating 150 minutes (9000 seconds) would be very expensive. If 1 credit = 1 second, 12,500 credits = 12,500 seconds = ~208 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Estimated Cost: ~$249.99/month</strong> (Google AI Ultra, assuming 12,500 credits covers 150 minutes)</li>

                <li>Standard plan ($12/month) includes 625 monthly credits. Pro plan ($28/month) offers 2250 credits. Unlimited plan ($76/month) provides unlimited relaxed-rate generations.</li>
                <li>Generating 150 minutes of video would likely require the **Unlimited plan**.</li>
