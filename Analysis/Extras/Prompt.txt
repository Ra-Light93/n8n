Hello Gemini,

Please use the following summary to get up to speed on my project. This is the context for our conversation.

**My Project: The Automated Content Factory**

My goal is to build an automated system for creating and posting social media content. I have completed the initial research and planning phase.

**1. My Chosen Niche:**
- I have decided to focus on creating **Islamic Religious Content**.
- The content will be inspirational and educational, such as daily reminders featuring Quranic verses or Hadith.
- The target audience is the global Muslim community, which is very large and highly engaged.
- I am aware that this niche requires absolute accuracy and a respectful tone.

**2. My Technical Plan & Workflows:**
I have designed two main automated workflows:

- **Workflow A: Timed Text Overlays:**
  - For creating subtitled videos.
  - The process: Use FFmpeg to extract audio -> Use Whisper AI API for transcription with word-level timestamps -> Use a script to generate FFmpeg commands that burn the text onto the video at the correct times.

- **Workflow B: AI-Generated Commentary:**
  - For creating transformative commentary videos.
  - The process: Use FFmpeg to extract keyframes from a video -> Use a multimodal AI (like GPT-4o) to analyze the images and generate a description -> Use an LLM to write a commentary script based on the description -> Use a TTS AI (like OpenAI TTS) to generate audio -> Use FFmpeg to combine the original video with the new commentary audio.
  - This is my preferred method for creating "fair use" compliant content.

**3. My Chosen Tools:**
- **Image Generation:** Leonardo AI.
- **Core Media Manipulation:** FFmpeg and the Pillow library (for Python).
- **AI Transcription:** Whisper AI API.
- **AI Analysis & Scripting:** GPT-4o or Gemini API.
- **Text-to-Speech:** OpenAI TTS API.

**4. Copyright Context:**
- I understand the basics of copyright and the "fair use" doctrine.
- I know that creating "transformative" work is key to a strong fair use argument, which is why I am focused on the AI Commentary workflow (Workflow B).
- I am aware of the high risks of using copyrighted material like anime clips and the lower (but still present) risks of using viral news-style videos.

**5. Project Files in the Ai-Explore Folder:**
This folder contains all the research and summary documents from our planning phase:
- `niche_recommendation.html`: Contains a ranked analysis of various content niches, with my final chosen niche ("Islamic Religious Content") included.
- `social_media_monetization_report.html`: A detailed report on how to monetize social media content across different niches.
- `research_summary.html`: A technical document (in German) outlining the tools and system design for the automated workflows.
- `cost.html`: An HTML report analyzing the costs of various AI tools, with Leonardo AI highlighted as my chosen tool.
- `BeforeFirstProject.html`: A comprehensive HTML summary of our entire conversation and project plan.
- `project_summary.txt`: This file itself, designed to be used as a context prompt.

Based on this context, I am now ready to discuss the next steps.
