1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
This baseball

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:00,980
coach made

3
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,380
a huge

4
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,020
mistake when

5
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:02,820
he underestimated

6
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,340
his students.

7
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,920
Because after

8
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,360
making a

9
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,680
bet that

10
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,120
they wouldn't

11
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,380
be able

12
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:05,620
to hit

13
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,180
these baseball

14
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,660
bats from

15
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,360
200 feet

16
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,660
away,

17
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,120
he quickly

18
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,880
realized why

19
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,180
that was

20
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,440
a bad

21
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,780
idea.

22
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,180
As soon

23
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,400
as the

24
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,840
kids started

25
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,280
throwing the

26
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,820
balls, it

27
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,120
looked like

28
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,460
the coach

29
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:12,960
was actually

30
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,220
right,

31
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,640
as none

32
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:13,880
of them

33
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,180
could hit

34
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,480
the bats.

35
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:14,740
So to

36
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,000
make it

37
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,480
easier for

38
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,800
them, the

39
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,420
coach decided

40
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:16,780
to add

41
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,140
two more

42
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:17,400
bats.

43
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,860
But despite

44
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,380
that, they

45
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,140
still couldn't

46
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,300
even hit

47
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:19,620
any of

48
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:19,960
them as

49
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,360
their aim

50
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,740
was way

51
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,200
too off.

52
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,860
However, when

53
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,060
it was

54
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,540
this kid's

55
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:22,860
turn, he

56
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,380
decided to

57
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:23,960
show everyone

58
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,440
how it's

59
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,960
really done.
