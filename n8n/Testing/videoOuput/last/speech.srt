1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140
This

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,440
baseball

3
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:00,680
coach

4
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:00,860
made

5
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:00,960
a

6
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,160
huge

7
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,500
mistake

8
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:01,660
when

9
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:01,740
he

10
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,340
underestimated

11
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,480
his

12
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,800
students,

13
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,320
because

14
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:03,620
after

15
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:03,840
making

16
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,000
a

17
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,160
bet

18
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,280
that

19
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:04,400
they

20
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,600
wouldn't

21
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:04,720
be

22
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:04,860
able

23
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:04,940
to

24
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,040
hit

25
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,180
these

26
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,520
baseball

27
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:05,760
bats

28
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:05,960
from

29
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,240
200

30
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,460
feet

31
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:06,720
away,

32
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,240
he

33
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,460
quickly

34
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:07,880
realized

35
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,180
why

36
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,340
that

37
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,440
was

38
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:08,540
a

39
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:08,680
bad

40
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:08,960
idea.

41
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:09,600
As

42
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,740
soon

43
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:09,840
as

44
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:09,900
the

45
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,040
kids

46
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,260
started

47
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,460
throwing

48
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:10,540
the

49
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:10,780
balls,

50
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,140
it

51
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,260
looked

52
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:11,380
like

53
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:11,460
the

54
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,600
coach

55
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:11,740
was

56
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,020
actually

57
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,300
right,

58
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:12,720
as

59
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:12,860
none

60
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:12,960
of

61
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,040
them

62
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,160
could

63
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,300
hit

64
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,380
the

65
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:13,620
bats.

66
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,200
So

67
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,280
to

68
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,420
make

69
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,500
it

70
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:14,780
easier

71
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:14,980
for

72
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,140
them,

73
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,580
the

74
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:15,780
coach

75
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,140
decided

76
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,300
to

77
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,460
add

78
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,660
two

79
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:16,860
more

80
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,160
bats.

81
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:17,720
But

82
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:17,940
despite

83
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,220
that,

84
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,560
they

85
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:18,820
still

86
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,200
couldn't

87
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,200
even

88
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,380
hit

89
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,600
any

90
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:19,740
of

91
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:19,900
them,

92
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,200
as

93
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,320
their

94
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,520
aim

95
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,640
was

96
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:20,880
way

97
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,060
too

98
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,320
off.

99
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,000
However,

100
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,180
when

101
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:22,280
it

102
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,380
was

103
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:22,560
this

104
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,840
kid's

105
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,060
turn,

106
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,440
he

107
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,740
decided

108
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:23,900
to

109
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,040
show

110
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,400
everyone

111
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:24,660
how

112
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:24,860
it's

113
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,120
really

114
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,400
done.
